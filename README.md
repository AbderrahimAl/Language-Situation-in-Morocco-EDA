### Analysis of the current language situation in Morocco

In Morocco, being multilingual is the norm. Morocco has two official languages: Arabic and Berber. Though French is considered to be Morocco’s unofficial (but often debated) third language. In schools, children are taught mostly reading and writing in Standard Arabic and in Darija for speaking. Along with that, French is found as the preferred language of business and government affairs. Berber languages are typically used in more informal situations — such as at home. On top of this, learning English for Moroccans, especially the youth, is growing in popularity (and is taught in schools).
